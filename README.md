🌱 I'm currently building my skills in data science and data engineering. Here are some of my favorite projects:
**My Projects:**
- 🔗 [Shampoo Recommender System](link) - Web-scraped thousands of shampoo reviews from Influenster.com; used cosine/spaCy similarity to
build customized recommender system based on user-selected product attributes such as "silky", "frizz-free", etc 
- 🔗 [Stock Portfolio Recommender](link) - Used integer and mixed integer programming to build optimal stock portfolio by
minimizing mean absolute error. Built portfolio of 25 stocks which closely mirrors performance of 100-stock index fund
- 🔗 [Movie Revenue Prediction](link) - Built random forest/bagging models to predict movie revenue; improved prediction
accuracy through feature engineering/extraction and log transformation of variables
- 🔗 [Skin Cancer Classification](coming soon) - Building deep learning model for skin cancer classification using convolutional neural network and transfer learning; working with a highly class imbalanced data set  
- 🔗 [Airbnb Price Prediction Model](link) - Built linear regression model to predict Airbnb nightly prices
<!-- TODO: Add future projects here: supply chain project (fork Ethan repo), market basket analysis from marketing
