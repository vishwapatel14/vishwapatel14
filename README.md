🌱 I'm currently building my skills in data science and data engineering. Here are some of my favorite projects:

**My Projects:**
- 🔗 [Shampoo Recommender System](link) - Web-scraped thousands of shampoo reviews from Influenster.com; used cosine/spaCy similarity to build customized recommender system based on user-selected product attributes such as "silky," "frizz-free," etc.
- 🔗 [Stock Portfolio Recommender](link) - Used integer and mixed integer programming to build an optimal stock portfolio by minimizing mean absolute error.
- 🔗 [Movie Revenue Prediction](link) - Built random forest/bagging models to predict movie revenue; improved prediction accuracy through feature engineering/extraction and log transformation of variables.
- 🔗 [Skin Cancer Classification](coming soon) - Building deep learning model for skin cancer classification using convolutional neural network and transfer learning; working with a highly class imbalanced dataset.
- 🔗 [Airbnb Price Prediction Model](link) - Built linear regression model to predict Airbnb nightly prices.

<!-- TODO: Add future projects here: supply chain project (fork Ethan repo), market basket analysis from marketing -->
